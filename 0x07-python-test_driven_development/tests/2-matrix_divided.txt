check error message with wrong data structure

>>> matrix = [[2, 4], "h"]
>>> try:
...     res = matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
...
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats



check error message with wrong list len

>>> matrix = [[2, 4], [1, 2], [2, 3, 4]]
>>> try:
...     res = matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
...
Each row of the matrix must have the same size



check error message with wrong divisor type

>>> matrix = [[2, 4], [1, 5]]
>>> try:
...     res = matrix_divided(matrix, "hello")
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
...
div must be a number



check error message with wrong divisor == 0

>>> matrix = [[2, 4], [1, 5]]
>>> try:
...    res = matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
... except TypeError as e:
...	print(e)
...
division by zero
